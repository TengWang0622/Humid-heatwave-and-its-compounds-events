Dear Users,

This project aims to elucidate the association between humid heatwave events (i.e., independent humid heatwave, ligth precipitation involved humid heatwave, and moderate precipitation involved humid heatwave) and ischemic heart disease (IHD) hospitalization risk and disease related economic burden.

For any enquires related to the R code, please contact:
Teng Wang: wang.teng19@alumni.imperial.ac.uk
Hanxu Shi: handsomegaoaixu@163.com

Three patterns of climate events are involved: Independent humid heatwave, Independent precipitation and their compounds. THe analysis contains both Pre-post and Propensity score matching aided difference in differences (PSM-DID) approach. Note that you have to specify which kind of event you would like to analyse and which observation window (warning, enduring or post periods) you are looking for.

Enjoy the codes.
Teng & Hanxu
